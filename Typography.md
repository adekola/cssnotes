# Working with Typography

#####Typeface vs Font
A _typeface_ is what you see, how the text looks, feels and reads.
A _font_ on the other hand is a file which contains a typeface. It is a font that allows the computer access a typeface. A useful analogy is to think of 
a font as a CD and typeface as a song. Font is what you use, Typeface is what you see or experience.

In building a website, the two most important factors affecting the look and legibility of the website are: **typeface** and **text color**

CSS offers _font-based properties_ as well as _text-based_ properties.

######Font-based properties
*`font-family` 
*`font-size`
*`font-family` - `italic, normal, oblique, inherit`.
*`font-variant` - to switch text to small capitals which is sometimes required. Values include `normal, small-caps, inherit`.
*`font-weight` - to change the weight of a typeface. Values include `normal, bold, bolder, lighter, inherit`. NUmeric values are possibel for typefaces with 
multiple weights, starting from 100 (thinnest) to 900 (thickest).
