#Backgrounds and Gradients

Backgrounds play an important role in the aesthetics of web pages and so deserve some forethought and deliberation.

###Properties
* `background-color` or `background` :  sets a solid color or a color/image respectively.

> To use transparent values (HSBa and RGBa), keep in mind to provide fallbacks so that browsers that don's support transparent color values can use the ones they do undertsand - hex and color keywords. Do this by sepcifying two background-color proerties; the safe one above, and the funky one below. (to take advantage of CSS cascading)
